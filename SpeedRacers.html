          of world. it has a place to spawn and move around and interact with
          items like, coins, buttons,and other Objects. Then Enter A 2 player

        <p>
          In SpeedRacers all The Menu Stuff takes place here,and 
          this is how it Works: Goes to StartMenu then the player
          Goes to Customizing The SpeedRacer Character, then after 
          Goes To Choosing Level Select were the only option is Grassland 
          For Now.
